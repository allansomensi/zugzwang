# Contributing ðŸš€

Thank you for considering contributing to **Zugzwang**! Your contributions help improve the game and make it better for everyone. Below is a guide to help you get started with the contribution process.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

To contribute, fork the repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes freely without affecting the main project until you're ready to submit them.

### 2. Create a New Branch ðŸŒ±

Create a new branch for your changes to keep your work isolated and make it easier to submit a pull request later. You can create a new branch using the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch
```

### 3. Linting and Code Quality ðŸ§¹

Before submitting your changes, please make sure that your code follows the project's coding standards. We recommend using the `just` command to perform linting and check your code with **Clippy**. To do this, run:


```elixir
just lint
```

This will ensure your code is free of common issues and adheres to the project's style guidelines.

### 4. Writing Tests ðŸ§ª

If you are adding new functionality or modifying existing code, please write tests to ensure that everything works as expected. The tests help maintain the general reliability and stability.

### 5. Commit Style ðŸ’¬

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format. Example:

```
feat(pieces): draw pieces on the board
```

Optionally, you can include emojis to add expressiveness and visual cues to your commits:

```
feat(pieces): :sparkles: draw pieces on the board
```

If you're using **VS Code**, you can simplify this process by installing the [Conventional Commits extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits), which assists you in formatting your commit messages consistently.

### 5. Submit a Pull Request ðŸ“¤

Once you've made your changes, it's time to submit a pull request. When doing so, make sure to:

- Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
- Include a summary of the changes you've made and why they are necessary.
- Reference any issues that your pull request addresses (if applicable).
- Make sure your pull request is targeting the main branch.

We truly appreciate your contributions! Every improvement, big or small, helps make a better game for everyone. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask. We're here to help!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
